**2. What is the difference between R and RStudio? What is GitHub and why is it useful to programmers?**
#R is a programming language for stats calculations and R Studio is an integrated development environment also known short as IDE.
**3. Navigate to my [BIS15L](https://github.com/jmledford3115/BIS15LW2022_jledford) repository on GitHub. Notice that near the bottom there is a nice, clean description of the repository. You want this on your repository! It is built by making edits to the `README.md` file using the RMarkdown conventions. Edit your repository's `README.md` file so that you have a clean informative description, including your email address. Be creative! You don't need to just copy mine. There are lots of examples online.**

**4. Calculate the following expressions. Be sure to include each one in a separate code chunk.**
+ 5 - 3 * 2
```r
5 - 3* 2
```
+ 8 / 2 ** 2
```r
8/2 ** 2
```
**5. Did any of the results in #4 surprise you? Write two programs that calculate each expression such that the result for the first example is 4 and the second example is 16.**

**6. `Objects` in R are a way in which we can store data or operations. We will talk more about objects next week. For now, make a new object `pi` as 3.14159265359 by running the following code chunk. You should now see the object `pi` in the environment window in the top right.**
```r
pi <- 3.14159265359
```

**7. Let's say we want to multiply `pi` by 2. Using the same arithmetic principles that we just learned, write a code chunk that performs this operation using the object we created.**
```r
pi <- 3.14159265359
```

**8. In order to get help with any command in R, just type a `?` in front the command of interest. Practice this by running the following code chunk.**
```r
x <- c(2, 8, 6, 6, 7, 4, 9, 9, 9, 10)
```
```r
mean(x)
```
**10. Repeat the procedure above, but this time calculate the median.**
